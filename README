Reading Sam's Learn Django in 24 hours
and I returned this book back to the library about 7 years ago.
This app uses sqlite rather than MySQL.
I am keot my hosted website (run.gorchs.net) in sync with my laptop using GitHub, I liked it but this website has been running without any needed maintenace for a long time and I have forgotten so much. Also I have a job so this project will not get much attention.
